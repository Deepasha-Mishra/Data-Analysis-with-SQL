AIM : Analysis focuses on observing the various factors that could have impacted in employee attrition other than the factors related to the work space

Data has been collected by company ABC to examine the state of employees in the company.

The management has contracted an HR analytics firm to understand what factors the company should focus on, in order to curb attrition. In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay. Also, they want to know which of the variables is most important and needs to be addressed right away. With the help of SQL this analysis can move forward ;

After the collection of data that would be insightful in the analysis, the data was reduced to a table with the help of MYSQL.
